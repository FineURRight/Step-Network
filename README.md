2. Dataset
The data set we use is the open source dataset DeepFashion(https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html).
The division of the training set and the test set follows the PATN authors, and likewise all the papers used for comparison in our article follow this division. We store the dataset partition and keypoints folder in the DATASET folder.

The face coordinates were predicted using the FaceNet network and saved as txt in the dataset folder.
